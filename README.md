# DenseNetworks

An implementation of standard dense neural networks. The implementation is based on Numpy only and does not need any further libraries. Test units for all classes are provided.

The implementation is extended to include a novel backprop. The loss function is defined as a sum of the loss of $\(\hat y\)$ with respect to $\(y\)$ and the loss of $\hat x$ with respect to $x$.
